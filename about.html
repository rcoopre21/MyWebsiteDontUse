<p> My name is Reagan E. Cooper (Hence <i>REC</i> Art) and I'm an artist from Columbus, Ohio! <br>
I'm 15 and I've been drawing for roughly 6 years. Currently, I am working to improve my art. <br>
I am extremely passionate about art and am interested in studying history and/or art history <br>
in college. My proudest acomplishment is when I was awarded an $100 scholarship for a pin <br>
design for summer art classes at CCAD, the college in downtown Columbus.</p>
