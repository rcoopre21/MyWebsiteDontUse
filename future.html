<p>In the future, I would like to improve my art and hopefully be able to sell it. Although I am not sure I want to <br>
pursue an art career in the future due to how difficult it is, I still like it and want it to be part of my life in <br>
the future. I am also very interested in the historical aspect of art and would be interested in most likely <br>
minoring it in college. I would like to major something in history as well if I do not pursue art.</p>
